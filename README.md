# Extension Spoofer
This trick uses Right to Left unicode to reverse the last six characters so that the extension is spoofed. For example, a notes.exe file can be renamed to notesexe.txt. Although the file extension clearly shows as .txt in Explorer, the Windows operating system still recognizes the file as an application. This character has a code: U+202e
